# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## how to use this:

You'll need Python3.

In the terminal, type `python3 main.py <book_path>` ex. books/frankenstein.txt.
It can analyze any text file's character count, sorted from most frequently appearing to least, and word count as long as you give it the path.

Enjoy!

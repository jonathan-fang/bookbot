# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## how to use this:

You'll need Python3.

In the terminal, type `python3 main.py <book_path>` ex. books/frankenstein.txt.

## features
It can analyze any text file's character count, sorted from most frequently appearing to least, and word count as long as you give it the path.

There is simple error handling for nonexistent files and incorrect syntax for queueing text files to be analyzed.

Enjoy!

## things to improve
- clean base environment and requirements.txt
